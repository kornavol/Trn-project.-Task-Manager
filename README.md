## DESCRIPTION

## Task

<https://www.figma.com/file/7HV64al5VorySNvRKlw2n4/404s-Art-Board?node-id=1021%3A16>

## Mini plan

- connect Bootstrap to setup
<https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/buttons/>

## for inspiration

<https://pomofocus.io/>

## To-do

- add a comparison id with DB and if it consist restart math.random
- try to use ? (ternary operator) instead if-else
- create a Name.jsx as page and replace it to app.jsx
- change all state (rendering new element) in a my project, as in example 13:50
- create a "accordion" for task which will be contain:
  - status (active, inactive)
  - data creation
- implement authorization
- implement menu (archive)
- add countdown to main window
- add countdown to "bookmark"

## Questions

- Why bubbling not working (click on a task)
    the problem was solved by itself
- alternative find method but without return
    forEach and return null as break

- Why "start" log always  = 0;
- Why my UseState is executing in the end even if "gate is closet".
- If  I re-render DOM with active UseEff (in process). This action is cloning the useEffect

## Bug

- After compute time period for first task, I create a new one  (which as default has status - active) and start time. The result will be wrong;
- I have an opportunity to create or move to task during tme computing (time counting). Need to fix.
